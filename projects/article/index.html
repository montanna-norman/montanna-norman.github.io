            <p> Jackson was the starting quarterback at the 2020 Pro Bowl in Orlando, Florida.
                He threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns with one interception and was named
                the offensive Most Valuable Player. Jackson became the youngest quarterback in NFL
                history to start a Pro Bowl game.[118]</p>

            <p> Jackson was voted the <b>MVP of the 2019 season</b>.[119]
                He became the second player after Tom Brady in 2010 to be voted
                unanimously[120][121][122][123] and the second-youngest player to win,
                behind only Jim Brown.[119] Jackson, along with Patrick Mahomes,
                Cam Newton and Steve McNair, is one of the four African-American quarterbacks
                to win the AP MVP award.[124] </p>

                on Christmas Day, Jackson threw for 252 yards, two touchdowns, and no
                interceptions for a 105.9 passer rating while also leading Baltimore with
                45 rushing yards.[179] In the next game against the Miami Dolphins, Jackson

                passer rating for the third time in his career, completing 18 of 21 passes
                for 321 yards, five touchdowns, and no interceptions during a 56â€“19 victory.
                [181] The win also clinched the top-seed in the AFC and the AFC North
                championship for the first time since 2019.[182]

                career highs in pass completions, completion percentage, and passing yards.
